### Motivation
I’m a Playwright. Which means, I make my living not being a Playwright, and then, when I’m not doing that, I write a lot of plays. So, it kills me when I have to waste time updating my playwriting site instead of actually creating plays. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a Developer, too. There’s nothing I love more than improving some code or re-designing a layout or learning about incorporating a new feature to a site or application. But if I’m simply adding a new play to the site or updating information about an old one, I take umbrage at the whole process. Grunt-work should be automated whenever possible. So, for my new site I created a form that allows me to dynamically style a new play’s show page as well as edit old pages with new information. This way I spend more time writing scripts (both dev and theatrical) and less time maintaining my site.

### Still To Do

The current design of the site is sub-par. My focus has been on building the database and backend structure. I intend on adding a React frontend to the site in the future and then I'll overhaul the design so it's more visually pleasing.
